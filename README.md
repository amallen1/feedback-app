- [] Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- [] Filter suggestions by category
- [] Add comments and replies to a product feedback request

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Express]
- [NodeJS]
- [MongoDB]

### What I learned

I learned how to easily handle form validation using a third party package called React Hook Form. It cut down the amount of code I had to write in order to achieve the same results which include forms that handle input errors appropriately, preventing invalid data from being submitted.
