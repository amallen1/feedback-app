## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

- Styled Components
- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- React Hook Form
- Redux Toolkit
- RTK Query

### Continued development

 At the moment a user create, read, update and delete suggestions and can sort through the list of feedback items on the suggestions homepage. Currently the only user on the application is the default "Guest/@GuestUser" to demonstrate how the application functions. As development continues, users will be able to create accounts under different names to upvote feedbacks and leave comments on feedback items. The roadmap page also shows an organized list of feedback suggestions that have a status of "Planned", "In-Progress", or "Live".
